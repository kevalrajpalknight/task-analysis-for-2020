# Task Completion Analysis

### Introduction
This is the hobby project, as 2020 year was such a trauma for entire world. There were so many ups and downs for me personally. I was less productive then 2019 despite, I was been at home but still I am trying to analysis this year productive for myself and try to find the reason why, what were the reason for that, where did I lack my persistence.

This project is created on 31/12/2020, I have tried to record the work which I accomplished as expected or the work I failed to accomplished. I tried to take some factor in consideration which might help me draw my analysis.


From what I concluded 2020 for me was literally less productive but I found some part where I can improve myself in 2021.
